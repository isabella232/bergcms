## Code

### We love pull requests

Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great
to know that you have a clean state.

3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need a test!

4. Make the test pass.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

### Coding Guidelines

* Four spaces, no tabs.
* UTF-8, LF only
* Prefer &&/|| over and/or.
* Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
* Use tool based formatting where available.
