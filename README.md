Berg
====

Berg is web based system for publishing a regular printed news letter,
e.g. a bimonthly parish newsletter. It is suitable for small editorial
committees.

The focus of the system is the next issue to publish. An issue consists
of several articles. These articles are preprocessed and then composited
by LaTeX. The outcome is a PDF file that can be downloaded and then
sent directly to the print shop.

The system was originally written by Heiko Decker using Perl. Work started
in 2006 and is used for production of a bimonthly parish newsletter since 2009.
Since 2011 the actual maintainer is Christian Leutloff. New modules are
written in C++.

Feedback is welcome. Patches and pull requests are even more welcome.

At the time of this writing the code is still missing. It will be added file by file in the next weeks ...
